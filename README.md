# Transformer Pirate Style Generator 🏴‍☠️

A transformer-based language model that translates normal English text into **pirate-style speech**, developed as part of the **Build Fellowship** project.

## 📜 Project Overview
This project is inspired by the idea of stylistic text generation.  
The goal is to build and train a transformer model that learns the unique vocabulary, sentence structures, and quirks of pirate slang — enabling it to rewrite normal sentences in an engaging, pirate-themed style.

The work follows the Build Fellowship project phases:
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Preparing a pirate slang dataset.
2. **Tokenization & Vectorization** – Converting text into machine-understandable format.
3. **Baseline Model** – Setting up a simple model for reference.
4. **Transformer Implementation** – Building a transformer from scratch.
5. **Training & Fine-Tuning** – Optimizing the model for pirate-style generation.
6. **Evaluation & Testing** – Ensuring the output matches the desired style.
7. **CLI Tool Deployment** – Enabling users to transform their own text into pirate-speak directly from the terminal.

## ⚓ Dataset
The dataset will contain:
- Common pirate slang phrases.
- Mapped examples of normal English → pirate-style translations.
- Additional curated text to enrich vocabulary and style.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (optional for preprocessing utilities)
- **CLI Tool** built with Python

## 🎯 Final Goal
By the end of this project, you'll be able to:
- Input: `"Where are you going?"`
- Output: `"Where be ye sailin’, matey?"`

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Web app version with a user-friendly interface.
- Expansion to other fun styles (e.g., Shakespeare, Yoda, etc.).
- Integration with chatbots for real-time pirate translation.
